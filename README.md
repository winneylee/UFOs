In this part of the website, we add in five filters: date, citi, state, country and shape, which allow viewer to enter any names or dates to get the results of UFOs from different area, different shape and duration when occurs, as well as description from people who have seen them. We also make it possible to enter different filters at the same time so people can get more specific result they wanted

## Summary

As the website provide much information about UFOs, it is not clear enough. So in order to improve our website, it is recommended to add some pictures of the UFOs when it occured that was taken by the people on the site, which will make it more vivid and more believable when people trying to do research about the UFOs on the website.
